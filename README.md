# Building Patrician #

Patrician uses scons as its build system. Scons is an alternative to make and can be downloaded from their [download page](http://scons.org/download.php).

Once scons is installed you can build Patrician by issuing the scons command from a command prompt in the base directory of the repository.

# Running Patrician #

Patrician builds to the bin directory inside the repository. After running the executable you can use the command "help" to see a list of commands available.
